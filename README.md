# IMS (Inventory Management System)

## Project Purpose

This repository serves as a learning and demonstration project showcasing modern software architecture and development practices in .NET. While it implements a basic inventory management system, its primary focus is on demonstrating:

- Clean Architecture implementation
- Domain-Driven Design patterns
- CQRS with MediatR
- Modern WPF development with MVVM
- Testing practices and patterns

> **Important**: This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes. The business logic is intentionally simplified to focus on architectural patterns and coding practices. It should not be considered a production-ready inventory management solution.

### Learning Objectives

   - Implementing Clean Architecture in a real-world application
   - Separating concerns across different layers
   - Managing dependencies through dependency injection

2. **Modern .NET Development**
   - Using latest .NET features and best practices
   - Implementing MVVM pattern with modern tooling
   - Working with asynchronous programming patterns

3. **Testing Approaches**
   - Writing unit tests for different architectural layers
   - Implementing UI tests for WPF applications
   - Using mocking and test doubles effectively

## Architecture

The solution follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Layer
1. **Domain (IMS.Domain)**
   - Contains enterprise/business logic
   - Implements DDD patterns (Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates)
   - Pure C# with no external dependencies
   - Business rules and invariants

2. **Application (IMS.Application)**
   - Application business rules
   - CQRS implementation with MediatR
   - Command and Query handlers
   - Interface definitions for infrastructure
   - DTOs and mapping profiles

### Infrastructure Layer
- Database access implementation
- External service integrations
- Repository implementations
- Logging, caching, and cross-cutting concerns

### Presentation Layer
- WPF UI implementation

5. **Modern UI**
   - Responsive WPF interface
   - MVVM pattern for maintainable UI code
   - Rich user experience
   - Validation and error handling

## Key Architectural Decisions and Benefits

### 1. Clean Architecture
**Decision**: Implemented a strict layered architecture with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers.

**Benefits**:
- ✨ Independent of frameworks, UI, and databases
- 🎯 Highly testable with business rules isolated in the domain layer
- 🔄 Easy to modify and maintain as changes are isolated to specific layers
- 📦 Better dependency management with clear boundaries
- 🚀 Ability to defer technical decisions as core business logic is isolated

### 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
**Decision**: Used DDD patterns for domain modeling with entities, value objects, and aggregates.

**Benefits**:
- 🏢 Rich domain model that accurately represents business concepts
- 💡 Encapsulated business rules within domain objects
- 🛡️ Strong invariants and validation at the domain level
- 📚 Shared language between developers and domain experts
- 🔒 Better data consistency through aggregate boundaries

### 3. CQRS with MediatR
**Decision**: Separated read and write operations using CQRS pattern, implemented via MediatR.

**Benefits**:
- 📈 Optimized read and write paths independently
- 🎭 Clear separation of command and query responsibilities
- 🔍 Simplified query models for better read performance
- 📝 Easier to maintain and modify individual operations
- 🎯 Better support for eventual consistency when needed

### 4. WPF with MVVM (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm)
**Decision**: Used modern MVVM implementation with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for UI development.

**Benefits**:
- 🎨 Clean separation of UI and business logic
- 🔄 Two-way data binding for responsive UI
- 🧪 Highly testable ViewModels
- 📱 Reusable view models across different views
- ⚡ Source generation for better performance

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Implemented multiple testing layers (Unit, Integration, UI, Architecture).

**Benefits**:
- 🛡️ Early detection of issues across all layers
- 🎯 Confidence in architectural boundaries
- 🔄 Safe refactoring with test coverage

### 9. Event-Driven Design
**Decision**: Implemented domain events for cross-cutting concerns.

**Benefits**:
- 🔄 Loose coupling between components
- 📦 Better separation of concerns
- 🎯 Easier to add new functionality
- 📈 Scalable architecture
- 🧪 Testable event handlers

### 10. Dependency Injection
