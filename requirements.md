# Inventory Management System Requirements

## System Overview
The Inventory Management System (IMS) is designed to handle complex inventory operations with a focus on item management and transactions. The system implements Domain-Driven Design principles to handle complex business rules and invariants.

## Domain Rules and Constraints

### Items
1. Each item must have a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
2. Items can be categorized into different types (Raw Materials, Finished Goods, Consumables)
4. Each item must maintain:
   - Minimum stock level (reorder point)
   - Maximum stock level (storage capacity)
   - Critical stock level (triggers urgent notifications)
5. Items can be marked as:
   - Active/Inactive
   - Perishable/Non-perishable
6. Perishable items must track:
   - Manufacturing date
   - Expiry date
   - Batch number
7. Items must maintain a quality status:
   - Good
   - Damaged
   - Under Inspection
   - Quarantined

### Item Transactions
1. Types of transactions:
   - Inbound (Purchase, Returns, Transfer In)
   - Outbound (Sales, Consumption, Transfer Out)
   - Internal (Quality Status Change, Location Transfer)
2. Transaction rules:
   - Cannot withdraw more than available quantity
   - Perishable items must follow FEFO (First Expired, First Out)
   - Non-perishable items follow FIFO (First In, First Out)
   - Quarantined items cannot be used in outbound transactions
3. Each transaction must:
   - Be traceable (audit trail)
   - Have a unique reference number
   - Record the user performing the action

## Aggregate Roots
1. Item (Root)
   - SKU
   - ItemDetails
   - QualityStatus
   - StorageLocations
   - StockLevels
   - BatchInformation (for perishables)

2. Transaction (Root)
   - TransactionReference
   - TransactionType
   - TransactionDetails
   - AuditInformation

## Value Objects
- SKU
- BatchNumber
- StockLevel
- QualityStatus
- LocationCode
- TransactionReference

## Domain Events
1. ItemCreated
2. StockLevelChanged
3. QualityStatusChanged
4. CriticalStockLevelReached
6. TransactionCompleted
